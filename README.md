hellomin.c
==========

hellomin.c is a minimal 1985 style Windows API Hello World.

Windows 1.0 was released on the 20th November 1985.
To commemorate its 30th birthday, I've written a shorter 
version of the infamously long "Hello World" sample.

The name of hellomin.c honours the eighties 8+3 character limit
for filename+extension.
